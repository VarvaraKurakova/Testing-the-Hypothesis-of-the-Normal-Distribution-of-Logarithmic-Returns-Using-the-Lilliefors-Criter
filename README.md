# Testing-the-Hypothesis-of-the-Normal-Distribution-of-Logarithmic-Returns-Using-the-Lilliefors-Criter
. Introduction
 Many analytical calculations and methods in statistics
based on the normal distribution. In most cases
such criteria depend on the sample size. And that is why when
in a deliberately small sample size, the criterion is often not worth
be used, since the reliability of the results will be extremely low. At
the study of sufficiently large samples, the criteria are always
quite accurately can give an answer about the normality of its distribution,
which is widely used in practice.
Purpose of the work: confirmation of the hypothesis that the logarithmic
the profitability of shares of companies in the period 04/04/2011-04/04/2021 did not
distributed normally.
