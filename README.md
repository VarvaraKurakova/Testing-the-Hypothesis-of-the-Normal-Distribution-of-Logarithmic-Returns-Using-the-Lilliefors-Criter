# Testing-the-Hypothesis-of-the-Normal-Distribution-of-Logarithmic-Returns-Using-the-Lilliefors-Criter
1. Introduction
 Many analytical calculations and methods in statistics
based on the normal distribution. In most cases
such criteria depend on the sample size. And that is why when
in a deliberately small sample size, the criterion is often not worth
be used, since the reliability of the results will be extremely low. At
the study of sufficiently large samples, the criteria are always
quite accurately can give an answer about the normality of its distribution, which is widely used in practice. Purpose of the work: confirmation of the hypothesis that the logarithmic the profitability of shares of companies in the period 04/04/2011-04/04/2021 did not distributed normally.

Work tasks:
1) Checking the performance of the Lilliefors criterion on model
data.
2) Analysis for the normality of the logarithmic stock returns
companies based on the Lilliefors criterion.
Research methods: Lilliefors test for analysis
the normality of the distribution of the logarithmic stock returns
companies. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion was also used
to assess the uniformity of the distribution of P-values ​​of statistics
Lilliefors on the interval [0;1].
Object of study: data of companies included in the S&P 500 index for
2012 - 2021 inclusive. Stock quotes of these tickers
have undergone significant changes due to the pandemic,
thereby confirming their relevance. There are 10 data in total
tickers for 10 years.
